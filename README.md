Usage
-----

Use your phone to configure multiple cache locations and units (metric/imperial). Enter the locations as decimal coordinates (e.g. -33.887233, 151.186150). Save the configuration by sending the data to watch.

Select a geocache from the menu on your watch.

Your pebble will show you the distance to the cache. Based on your choice above, the distance will be shown either in metric or imperial units.

A black dot shows the heading to the cache. A white dot indicates your own heading, based on your own movement. If the dots touch each other, you are moving into the right direction.

If the watch doesn't show your location or movement correctly, you can try to test the location capability of your phone with [another Pebble app](https://apps.rebble.io/applications/54b3cfebd5587f3596000056).
